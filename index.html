            <div class='line'>
                <h2 class='pop-outin'>Check out these FREEEEE rules to get rich!!!!</h2>
            </div>

            <!-- Rule 1 -->

            <h1 class="animate-charcter">1. Anyone can get rich!!!1</h1>
            <br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/pbWtfbG.gif" class="w3-image w3-padding-32" width="300" height="300">


            <p>As a graduate of Life University®, you heard it from me!!!!
                <br>
                I used to work at an inn and interviewed the richest clients on their secrets! They all agree with
                this
                list!
            </p>

            <!-- Rule 2 -->
            <h1 class="animate-charcter">2. Set yourself up for riches!!!</h1>
            <br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/5Icph0L.gif" class="w3-image w3-padding-32" width="300" height="300">

            <p>You ever hear of "setting yourself up for failure"? Well you can do the same thing to set yourself up
                for
                riches!
                <br>
                Every morning I wake up with my arms outstretched and I scream, "Money, get ready for me!"
                <br>
                I'm always wearing my business wear because it's always time to hustle!! Everyone and anyone is a
                potential client!
            </p>

            <!-- Rule 3 -->
            <h1 class="animate-charcter">3. Have confidence!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
            <br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/uE0u8NE.gif" class="w3-image w3-padding-32" width="300" height="300">

            <p>Get friendly like me! AGRESSIVELY FRIENDLY!
                <br>
                I didn't get rich like this by having no friends1!1
                <br>
                Face life as a challenge! If I get knocked down, you bet yourself I'm getting back up because I'm
                confident that positivity is waiting for me!
            </p>

            <!-- Rule 4 -->

            <h1 class="animate-charcter">4. There's no such things as failures, just successful experiments!</h1>
            <br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/k1k7w5R.gif" class="w3-image w3-padding-32" width="300" height="300">

            <p>When first receiving my financial coach services, loads of clients get upset that they're losing
                money to
                me.
                <br>
                But is it really a loss if there is something to be gained in the future?! This is INVESTING!!! This
                is
                NOT a scam!!!11
            </p>

            <!-- Rule 5 -->

            <h1 class="animate-charcter">5. There are no rules!!!</h1>
            <br>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/6XM7U1A.gif" class="w3-image w3-padding-32" width="300" height="300">


            <p>This is a HUGE rule1!@ That's why you need me, an experienced graduate of Life University® to help
                you
